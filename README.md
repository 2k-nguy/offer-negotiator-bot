You can modify response templates in `neogiator_bot.py`:

```python
ResponseTemplate(
    template_id="custom_template",

    variables=["variable1", "variable2"],
    effectiveness_score=0.85
)
```

The bot automatically identifies leverage points, but you can add custom ones:

```python
bot.add_leverage_point(context_id, "custom_leverage_point")
```

### Strategy Customization

Switch strategies mid-negotiation:

```python
bot.update_strategy(context_id, NegotiationStrategy.CONFIDENT_ASSERTIVE)
```
